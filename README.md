# seat_dhor_project
From sign-up and login to booking seats and managing schedules, this project helped me dive deep into:  
ğŸ”¹ Structured C programming  
ğŸ”¹ File I/O (users.txt, shuttle.txt, booking.txt, admin.txt)  
ğŸ”¹ Input validation (student ID, password rules)  
ğŸ”¹ Admin controls with passkey security  
ğŸ”¹ Real-time features like next available shuttle &amp; token generation
